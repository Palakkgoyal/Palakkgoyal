Hi!

Name: `Palak Goyal`

I've been enjoying programming since learning DSA with Java, then shifting to JavaScript for frontend. However, UI work didn't appeal to me. Now, I'm diving into Rust, seeking more logic and challenges.
Wanna watch my Rust playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5b_fLu-Jx2nrbCTqD_7fh0S-qC-kDp9B

Skills: `Rust` `HTML` `CSS` and you guessed it right `JavaScript`ðŸ˜œ, `React` `Tailwind` `Firebase`

Also worked with: `Java` `Python` `Nextjs`, `Sanity` and `Typescript`
